## Abstract
<p align = "justify">The aim of this project is to predict the inverse kinematics of a two link simulator or in 
simpler words we have to predict the angles q1 and q2 which would get the desired end affector position given as input, of a robotic arm with 2 degree of freedom.  </p>

## Motivation
<p align = "justify">Deep Learning has been such a great tool in field of robotics. The ability to do define set of rules given a lot of input and output data, 
has made it a lot of use in research projects.
<br></br>
Our project inspires us to solve many real world problem like autonomous robotic arm with desired degree of freedoms.
